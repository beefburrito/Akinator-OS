# Akinator-OS
## Introduction
OSAkinator is a java program that reads data from an excel file which has both an entity and attributes associated with it.
When executing the program, it will ask various questions regarding the attributes and should it match one of the entities it will tell 
the user about it.
## Requirements
- java (https://www.java.com/en/download/)
- apache-poi (https://poi.apache.org/)

In my case I used eclipse, an IDE that specializes in writing programs in java language.
